# library_app

A new Flutter project.

An Android app that allows a user to input books that they have in their personal library and save them to a local database style storage. They can view and search their list of books even if they do not have cell service or wifi. They can add and delete books without using the internet as well. If they want cover art for any of their books, they can search for it by clicking an icon; this icon sends a post request to an image finding service and replace the current image with the found image and saves the the image to the books database information. there is also an icon that sends a get request to a different service that finds a list of sellers and prices for a specified book that the user might want to purchase.
