New Mobile Application


When running this app, I used an android virtual device modeled on a Samsung Galaxy S10e phone. Staring the microservice router first and then the app is the preferable
way to run the software. The server is built with python, as are the services integrated into the server, so you should have at least a 3.8 python interpreter to run the
server. All you need to do is call the name of the server file 'server.py' in a valid interpreter to start the server on a localhost. The application has it's only way;
the 'main.dart' file has a play button at the top that starts the app, you do need flutter installed however to run it.
